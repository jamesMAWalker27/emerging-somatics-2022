        Unclear if somatic coaching and/or somatic bodywork is for you? That's OK, and let's have a conversation about it.
        <br />
        So far Iâ€™ve worked with movement organizers, entrepreneurs, executives, leaders, young professionals, members of the Navy, soon-to-be parents, current and former professional and olympic athletes, and many other identities people carry.
        <br />I think somatic coaching and bodywork can benefit all, and at the same time is not for everyone. I am also not the coach/bodyworker for everyone. That's OK, too.
