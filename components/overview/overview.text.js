      Somatics works against the backdrop of questions like &quot;What do you care
      about?&quot;, &quot;Who do you want to become?&quot;, &quot;What change do you want to affect
      for yourself, your family and intimate network, your organization, your
      community, the world?&quot;, &quot;What do you long for?&quot;, &quot;What wants to come to
      life?&quot;
    </span>
    <span>
      By taking into account the whole soma (person) with its rational,
      emotional and social intelligence it provides a deeper answer to these
      questions, and practices to fulfilling on embodying these commitments that
      surface.

      Ideally 5-10 sessions of 45-90 mins. There’s flexibility in terms of
      scheduling (i.e. it doesn’t have to be a fixed interval between sessions,
      and I can accommodate schedules e.g. we can meet weekly, bi-weekly,
      monthly, ad-hoc). You can schedule the first session using this link - if
      these times do not work for you, please let me know as I‘m happy to
      accommodate your preferences.
    </span>
    <span>
      Meetings can be conducted over Zoom and/or in person. I’d prefer in
      person, as that can make somatic practices more powerful. However, the
      first session can be done online easily.

      Besides reflecting on ground covered/questions, and taking up practices
      that emerge during sessions, I will ask for a daily practice of centering
      (less than 10mins) and meditation (consistency is more important than
      durations, so 10-15mins daily will do). I am doing this myself as well.
    </span>
    <span>
      We can go through a centering practice during our first session, and I
      will explain the relevance for practicing. We are what we practice, and we
      are never not practicing.

      I am not looking for compensation until I am certified - and only
      applicable for new clients who start after I receive my certification.
      However, if you find the coaching experience valuable beyond the time that
      you are investing into yourself here, and you feel moved to pay for
      sessions at some point, feel free to raise this topic with me then.
