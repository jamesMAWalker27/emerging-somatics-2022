      If you are new to somatic coaching, you will learn not only a basic
      understanding, but also a felt experience of somatics such as the arc of
      transformation as well as somatic awareness, somatic opening and somatic
      practices (do not worry, I will explain these terms further in our first
      sessions). I will also help you to create a declaration for yourself. You
      can understand a declaration as a commitment to a future vision you have
      for yourself, based on what you deeply care about.
    </span>
    <span>
      A declaration mobilizes your intention, mobilizes those around you, as you
      start to embody the vision you have about your future. In this context
      embodiment means that your entire being - actions, thinking, speech,
      emotions, moods & physical presence - are reflecting your declaration.

      Ideally 5-10 sessions of 45-90 mins. There’s flexibility in terms of
      scheduling (i.e. it doesn’t have to be a fixed interval between sessions,
      and I can accommodate schedules e.g. we can meet weekly, bi-weekly,
      monthly, ad-hoc). You can schedule the first session using this link - if
      these times do not work for you, please let me know as I‘m happy to
      accommodate your preferences.
    </span>
    <span>
      Meetings can be conducted over Zoom and/or in person. I’d prefer in
      person, as that can make somatic practices more powerful. However, the
      first session can be done online easily.

      Besides reflecting on ground covered/questions, and taking up practices
      that emerge during sessions, I will ask for a daily practice of centering
      (less than 10mins) and meditation (consistency is more important than
      durations, so 10-15mins daily will do). I am doing this myself as well.
    </span>
    <span>
      We can go through a centering practice during our first session, and I
      will explain the relevance for practicing.
    </span>
    <span>We are what we practice, and we are never not practicing.</span>

      If you find the coaching experience valuable beyond the time that you are
      investing into yourself here, and you feel moved to pay for sessions at
      some point (e.g. it would make you happy to pay), feel free to raise this
      topic with me.

      I am a Certified Somatic Coach by Strozzi Institute. Richard
      Strozzi-Heckler was the lead teacher in my cohort, and has been spending
      over 4 decades researching, developing and teaching Somatics.
    </span>
    <span>
      In addition, I am also a certified somatic bodyworker by Strozzi
      Institute, having learned from Staci Haines in Strozzi Institute's Somatic
      Bodywork Level 1 course in September 2021, as well as from Richard Strozzi
      in November 2022. Wendy Haines, who also taught in our coaching program
      with Richard, continues to be my somatic coach.
    </span>
    <span>
      Furthermore, I'm continuously participating in courses exploring the
      intersection of somatics and racial justice work.
