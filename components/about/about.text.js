    Hi! I&apos;m David, and before I get into the details I want to acknowledge the obvious: an 'about me' section on a website, in particular as it relates to somatics, is probably missing (more than) half the 'picture'.
  </span>
  <span>
    If you’d like to know more, what follows will give you a little more of an understanding of who I am, and what has shaped me. Hopefully, my story can inspire some curiousity about somatic coaching and/or bodywork.

    Within Strozzi Somatics, we look at so-called sites of shaping and sites of change, that go beyond the individual, family and intimate network and include community, instituations, social norms, historical forces, landscape and spirit that shape us into who we are in this present moment. I am happy to elaborate on these further if you’d like to take the time.

      For now what feels relevant for me to share is certain experiences in my life that have significantly shaped me into who I am today.

      I was shaped by growing up in a rural town in North-West Germany until I was 20 years old (Ibbenbueren, if you fancy looking it up).
    </span>,
    <span>
      I was shaped by first experiencing a different culture when I was 17 years old and then traveling to Brazil for a month each in 2003 and again in 2004.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I was shaped by serving my civil service in Germany in a Kindergarten for speech-disabled children.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I was shaped by living in England, Germany (first Muenster than Munich), Singapore, then back to Germany, and then back to England from 2006-2010.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I am shaped by living in the U.S.: first in San Francisco in 2010-2011, and since then in Los Angeles (with the exception of living in New York City in 2015).
    </span>,
    <span>
      I was shaped by playing soccer at the club-level my entire childhood; then finding a passion for competitive cycling on the road since 2006, and on the dirt (MTB) since 2020, and most recently also diving into the world and teachings of Aikido, a martial art in the spirit of harmony and loving protection toward all beings, where I am a member of AKI USA's Los Angeles dojo training under Lia Suzuki Sensei.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I was shaped by studying first "European Business Programme" for undergrad, and second "International Business" in business school, with people from 55 different countries from all
      different continents (except antarctica)
    </span>,
    <span>
      I was shaped by starting my career in the investment management world at Oaktree Capital Management in 2011, never working anywhere else, and leaving that career as a Senior Vice President in August 2021.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I am shaped by loving parents, and also their divorce when I was 21.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I am shaped by my two brothers, who I am very close with, despite living 5,794 miles away (that is code for 9,324 kilometers).
    </span>,
    <span>
      I was shaped by my romantic relationships, the notion that there is only one kind of love and it only exists in those, and the inability to give and/or receive this love.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I am shaped by my friends, close and far, distance-wise and otherwise; those that have been there seemingly forever, those that are new, and those that have disappeared, and where I disappeared. And those where our friendship naturally ended. And those that will come.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I am also shaped by the lived experiences of my ancestors. The 'good' and the 'bad'.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I am shaped by white supremacy, patriarchy and capitalism and the privileges these and other systems of oppressions have provided me as a white male. And within the last two years, I am shaped by more significantly and actively working on and contributing to dismantling these systems of oppression, for us all and myself, and am committed and passionate to do so until they no longer exist, or I no longer exist.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I am shaped by Strozzi Institute somatics, in particular through their Embodied Leadership course I attended in 2019 in my role as a team-lead at Oaktree, and further as well as even more transformative through their formal Somatic Coach certification program (attended in 2021), and their Somatic Bodywork Level 1 certification (also 2021), as well as their outstanding teachers and leaders in the field of somatics. Namely Richard Strozzi-Heckler, Staci Haines and Wendy Haines, the latter of who is also my current somatic coach.
    </span>,
    <span>
      I am shaped by trainings and actively organizing with White People 4 Black Lives, which is part of Showing Up for Racial Justice (SURJ) - a national network of white anti-racists, as well as work done through the “In Our White Bodies” Collective.

      And, I am also shaped by you, my past, current and future clients who I had the opportunity and privilege to work with and learn from.
    </span>,
    <span>
      Again, the above probably misses (more than) half the 'picture'. That's OK. I am not here on this path to complete the picture.
    </span>,
    <span>
      As a coach, my role is not to provide advise to you and my other clients based on my lived experiences. As a coach, my role is to help you facilitate the transformation you envision for yourself.
    </span>,
    <span>
      This is usually really exciting, motivating and energizing, and it can also be daunting, scary and painful in the process, as we face something new. I am sharing all of this for you to take in and decide if you would like to explore this further with me as your coach in this process.
